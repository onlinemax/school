The formula for the experiment must be verified. The new research assistants have reproduced it below. This formula is crucial for fueling the next steps in our research.
The results indicate a possible breakthrough.
The formula is not just theoretical; it has practical applications. A breakthrough would dramatically reduce laboratory expenses. However, with great (purchasing) power comes great responsiblity... I believe we can handle it.
Pizza cost per square inch = Price / (π × (Diameter / 2)^2)
